step 0: find k-means centers of movie and get a distribution of the existing movie

step 1: find the cell

step 2: convert the cell into lower dimentional representation from the k-means clusters

step 3: create RNN that takes as input the lower dimentional representation and outputs the same size representation

step 4: create GAN that can take a lower dimentional representation and generate a full-size representation that looks like the k-means clusters

step 5: fill in the GAN output background parts with the distribution of noise from the original movie

step 5.5: find out where the spots are supposed to be...

step 6: create NN that can fill in the spots with pixels that look like spots (maybe need another GAN for this)

Repeat steps 1-6 as long as possible
